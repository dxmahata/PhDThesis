With the popularity of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc, there has been voluminous growth in the digital footprints of real-life events in the Internet. The user generated colloquial and concise textual content related to different types of real-life events, produced in these websites,  acts as a hotbed for researchers and organizations for extracting valuable and meaningful information. There has been significant improvement in natural language processing techniques for mining formal and long textual content often found in blogs and newspaper articles. But, it is still a challenging task to mine textual information from the social media channels producing terse, informal and noisy text with an unusual structure. For  an event of interest it is necessary to detect and store event-specific signals from the noisy social media channels that allows to distinctively identify that event among all others and characterizes it for drawing actionable insights. These event-specific cues also forms its identity in the unstructured domain of social media. This identity information when mined and analyzed in a timely manner has tremendous applications in the areas of real-life event analysis, opinion mining, reference tracking, recommendation engines, cyber security, event management, among others. Thus, there is a need of a generic framework that can collect short textual content related to real-life events, extract information from them and maintain the information persistently for performing data analytics tasks, and tracking newly produced content as an event evolves. The patent pending work presented in this thesis establishes the design and implementation of an extendable framework enabling collecting, extracting and persistently managing identity information of real-life events from short textual content produced in social media. Towards this objective a pipeline of data processing components going through repeated processing cycles - \textit{Event Identity Information Management Life Cyle} (EIIM) is proposed. A novel persistent graph data structure - \textit{EventIdentityInfoGraph} representing the identity information structure of an event is implemented that forms the core component of the EIIM cycle. Mutually reinforcing relationships between event-specific social media posts, hashtags, text units, URLs and users, forming the vertices of the graph and denoting \textit{event identity information units}, are defined and quantified. An iterative and scalable algorithm - \textit{EventIdentityInfoRank} is proposed that processes the vertices of the graph and ranks them  in terms of event-specific informativeness by leveraging the mutually reinforcing relationships. The ranked \textit{event identity information units} are further used in tracking new event related content and extracting valuable event-specific information. Different components of the framework are tested and validated for real-time event related content generated in social media. The work is concluded by discussing about its novel contributions, practical applications in various other domains and envisaging future directions.

I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my committee chair Dr. John R. Talburt, who has shown the attitude and the substance of a genius. He continiously and persuasively conveyed a spirit of adventure in regard to research and scholarship, and an excitement in regard to directing innovation towards practical problems. Without his supervision and constant support this dissertation would not have been possible.

   I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Elizabeth Pierce, Dr. Ningning Wu, Dr. Russel Bruhn and Dr. Mathias Brochhausen, whose high quality contributions in the field of Information Science and Information Quality have inspired me to set high standards in my work, and kept me motivated. I would specially thank Dr. Mathias Brochhausen for devoting his valuable time for discussing about possible applications of ontologies in representing real-life events and the related information content in social media. I strongly consider it as one of the future directions of my research.

    In addition, I thank Dr. Vivek Kumar Singh and his team from Banaras Hindu University, India, for collaborating with me and helping me to execute the necessary evaluation tasks in an unbiased way, including manual annotations and feedback. I also acknowledge the support of Mr. Jeff Stinson and Ms. Glediana Rexha for financially supporting the major part of my PhD by allowing me to work as a Graduate Assistant at TechLaunch, University of Arkansas at Little Rock. 

I am extremely thankful to Dr. Abhijit Bhattacharyya (Associated Dean, Donaghey College of Engineering and Information Technology), for providing me with advise and encouragement from time to time. This acknowledgement page would be incomplete without thanking the immense support of my friends and family. I thank my parents, wife and friends (specially Pathikrit Bhattacharya, Subhashish Duttachowdhury and Meenakshisundaram Balasubramaniam) for not only their support but for their constant interest in my work and the discussions that I had with them. The conversations with them helped me to understand the information seeking behavior of various people from social media, with different perspectives.

Lastly, I thank University of Arkansas for providing me with the facilities, funds and a congenial environment for working towards my goal of PhD. I also acknowledge the Board Of Trustees Of The University Of Arkansas for filing a provisional patent of my work and encouraging me to pursue a path of innovation.

With the popularity of Twitter, there has been voluminous growth in the digital footprints of real-life events in the Internet. The references to different types of events in Twitter have the potential to provide extremely valuable information to researchers and organizations, which could be mined and analyzed for making major decisions. There are tremendous applications in the areas of real-life event analysis, opinion mining, reference tracking, online advertising, recommendation engines, cyber security, event management, enterprise data integration, among others. Thus, there is a need of a generic framework that can collect different event references, extract identity information of the events from them and maintain the information persistently for resolving new references to the events and provide updated analytics. The presented research establishes the design and implementation of such a framework from the perspective of Event Identity Information Management (EIIM) in the domain of Twitter. The paper introduces the problem of EIIM in Twitter, discusses the prevalent challenges and proposes the design of a framework capable of managing persistent identity information of pre-specified set of events. We explore the applications of the research, validate the different components of the framework and conclude with our comments on various criteria showing high efficacy and practical utility of our proposed framework.\ldots

I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my committee chair Dr. John R. Talburt, who has shown the attitude and the substance of a genius. He continiously and persuasively conveyed a spirit of adventure in regard to research and scholarship, and an excitement in regard to directing innovation towards practical problems. Without his supervision and constant support this dissertation would not have been possible.

 

   I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Elizabeth Pierce, Dr. Ningning Wu, Dr. Russel Bruhn and Dr. Mathias Brochhausen whose high quality contributions in the field of Information Science and Information Quality have inspired me to set high standards in my work, and kept me motivated. I would specially thank Dr. Mathias Brochhausen for devoting his valuable time for discussing about possible applications of ontologies in representing real-life events and the related information content in social media. I strongly consider it as one of the future directions of my research.

    In addition, I thank Dr. Vivek Kumar Singh and his team from Banaras Hindu University, India, for collaborating with me and helping me to execute the necessary evaluation tasks in an unbiased way, including manual annotations and feedback. I also acknowledge the support of Mr. Jeff Stinson and Ms. Glediana Rexha for financially supporting the major part of my PhD by allowing me to work as a Graduate Assistant at TechLaunch, University of Arkansas at Little Rock. 

I am extremely thankful to Dr. Abhijit Bhattacharyya (Associated Dean, Donaghey College of Engineering and Information Technology), for providing me with advise and encouragement from time to time. This acknowledgement page would be incomplete without thanking the immense support of my friends and family. I thank my parents, wife and friends (specially Pathikrit Bhattacharya, Subhashish Duttachowdhury and Meenakshisundaram Balasubramaniam) for not only their support but for their constant interest in my work and the discussions that I had with them. The conversations with them helped me to understand the information seeking behavior of various people from social media, with different perspectives.

Lastly, I thank University of Arkansas for providing me with the facilities, funds and a congenial environment for working towards my goal of PhD. I also acknowledge the Board Of Trustees Of The University Of Arkansas for filing a provisional patent of my work and encouraging me to pursue a path of innovation.

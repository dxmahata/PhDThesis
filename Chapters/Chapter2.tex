\section{Social Media}
Social media is defined as a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content \cite{kaplan2010users}. These Internet-based applications broadly ranges from blogs, microblogs, media sharing webistes, social bookmarking websites, social news to social networking websites. Brief description of the most popular types of social media websites is given below.

\subsection{Blogs}
A blog can be defined as a website that displays, in a reverse chronological order, the entries by one or more individuals and usually has links to comments on specific postings. Blogs often provide opinions, commentaries, or news on a particular subject, such as food, politics, or local news. Some of them also function as personal online diaries. Most of the time the entries of a blog is archived and is accessible at a later time. For the purpose of constant syndication, RSS or XML feeds for the blogs are made available. An individual entry in a blog is known as a blog post. A typical blog post can combine text, images and links to other blogs, web pages and other media related to its topic. The universe of all the blogs on the Internet is known as blogosphere \cite{agarwal2014time}.

\subsection{Microblogs}
Microblogs are similar to blogs, but a shorter version of it. Most of the microblogging websites pose limitations on the length of an individual post. Twitter, one of the most popular microblogging website has a limitation of 140 characters. This makes the textual posts in these platforms, extremely concise. Users often associate URLs that lead to external sources of information related to the posts. A post may also contain attached image or video. The microblogging services mostly focus on short updates that are pushed out to anyone subscribed to receive the updates. This is made possible by enabling the users to form directed networks of \textit{friends} and \textit{followers}. The \textit{followers} of an user are entitled to get all the updates posted by him. Mostly these updates are public. 

\subsection{Media Sharing}
Media sharing services allow its users to upload and share various multimedia content such as pictures and videos. Most services have additional social features such as profiles, commenting, etc. The most popular are Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Flickr. The media elements are often enriched with geographical and topical ``tags'' by the users who create them and the consumers who browse them. These tags acts as very useful meta data and allow automated programs to leverage them for efficient organization and retrieval of the videos and images that otherwise have very less textual content. 

\subsection{Social Bookmarking}
These are the genre of social media services that allow its users to save, organize and manage links to various websites and resources around the internet. Most allow to ``tag" URLs for making them easy to search and share. The most popular are Delicious and StumbleUpon. Some of the services like StumbleUpon also allow their users to form friendship networks. These websites often provide different browsing experiences through interfaces that help the users to search for most recent tags, most popular ones, and so on.

\subsection{Social News}
Social news websites allow people to post various news items or links to articles that are external to the website, and then allows its users to cast their ``vote' on the items. The voting is the core social aspect as the items that get the most votes are displayed most prominently. This makes it an ideal crowdsourced news platform. It is up to the community of users to decide which news items gets seen by more people. Users can also ``tag'' the news stories and comment on them. The most popular are Digg and Reddit.

\subsection{Social Networking}
Social networking websites are the ones that allow its users to connect with each other and form networks. The connections are generally non-directional and reciprocal. Two users who are connected to each other are considered as \textit{friends}. Usually the users in these webistes have a profile that presents the personal information of the user as provided by him. The users have various ways to interact with other users, and also sometimes have the ability to set up groups. These social networks may be based on a certain theme such as interests, location, and profession. Facebook is the most popular personal social network and LinkedIn is the most popular professional network.

Some of the other types of websites that can also be categorized as social media services are, social messaging services, collaboration tools, rating or review sites, personal broadcasting tools, virtual worlds, and group buying. Table \ref{socialmediacat}, lists popular social media websites in different categories. Some of the websites may overlap and fall into multiple categories due to the broad range of services provided by them. For example, Facebook is not only a popular social networking website, but also a widely used social messaging service.

\section{Characteristics of Social Media Websites\label{char}}
All the above social media websites exhibit certain common characteristics that is also responsible for their wide usage and huge popularity. We revisit some of the characteristics as already suggested by Agarwal et al. \cite{agarwal2010information} in the context of this dissertation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Accessibility:} Social media websites are freely available to whoever has an Internet connection. This makes these websites easily accessible all over the world. One of the latest initiatives by Facebook and Google is to make social media accessible even to the most remote corner of the world through their Internet.org\footnote{http://internet.org/} and ``Loon for All"\footnote{http://www.google.com/loon/} projects, respectively. With the popularity of hand held devices and increase in the Internet bandwidth, social media is accessible to anyone who has a smart phone and can use it. This is unlike the mainstream media or the print media, to which people subscribe and buy in the form of magazines, newspapers, journals, etc. Also, the mainstream media can be easily controlled by the government that may lead to propagation of biased information. For example, during the ``Egyptian Revolution of 2011", the mainstream media was biased, regulated by the government, and did not portray the true picture of the situation in Egypt. On the other hand, it was social media through which people discussed about the actual atrocities of the government and grouped together to incite the entire revolution \cite{hamdy2012framing}.

\item \textbf{Permanence:} Social media websites show dynamic nature and the content can be altered any time.  Users can easily edit the content shared by them. On the other hand the traditional print media and television media is not at all dynamic. Once an article is printed in a magazine/newspaper, or a television show is recorded and broadcasted, it cannot be changed.

\item \textbf{Reach:} As already presented in Table \ref{socialmediastat}, some of the popular social media websites have a reach of billions. Moreover, the ability of an individual user to simultaneously network with many other users makes this reach more effective than any other means of communication. These connections acts as networks of information flow, which helps in spreading any kind of information at a lightning speed \cite{bakshy2012role}. Also it provides equal opportunity to everyone for reaching their intended audience, unlike the traditional mainstream media. This characteristic is now regularly used by politicians for launching election campaigns and reaching out to people in social media \cite{metzgar2009social}. The marketers also leverage social media to a great extent. Event managers also take advantage of it, due to which social media has become an integral part of event management for getting connected with the event audience \cite{socialmediaforevents}. Social media is regularly used during planned events for making announcements, building and tracking audience, building focused communities, developing public relations \cite{eyrich2008pr}, and targeted marketing \cite{mangold2009social}. Due to easy reachability in social media, a focused group of people can also get together very quickly and organize events such as flashmobs and protest movements \cite{sen2012identifying}. 

\item \textbf{Recency:} The time lag at which communication can take place and information can flow is almost zero for the social media websites. Content is produced and communicated in real-time. Once this content is consumed, the users discuss about it instantaneously. Due to the reach and recency of social media it can make people aware of newsworthy events at a faster pace than traditional maintream media \cite{phelan2009using,petrovic2013can}. It might take hours, days, or sometimes months to present news or an event through mainstream media like newspapers, magazines and television. For example, the death of Bin Laden and the entire covert opertation was reported in Twitter even before the US president made an official announcement in the mainstream media \cite{ladendeathnews}. The users in social media were not only aware of the event but were also sharing and discussing it with great zeal.  Another example is of the theater shootings in Colorado \cite{coloradoshooting}. The shooting incident was reported, covered and analyzed in real-time, with traditional news media lagging behind social media by several minutes.

\item \textbf{Usability:} Social media sites are extremely easy to use and are user-friendly. An user does not require special training or skills to create content in a social media website. Whoever, can type or use a device connected to the Internet that enables typing of text can share information in social media. Therefore, the operational cost of any social media application is mostly negligible. This is not the case for mainstream media. In order to report an event one needs to be skilled and specially trained. Also, the printing and telecasting of any event has to go through many other processes and has to be finally approved by the editor. This makes traditional media unusable by common people. The use of social media at the time of Internet blackout during the ``Egyptian Revolution of 2011" is a great example of its usability \cite{egyptianrevinternetblackout}. The Egyptian government had throttled the Internet connection and there was an Internet blackout for hours in order to stop the spreading of messages in social media, which was the major media of communication that led to the protest movements and finally to the revolution. In order to counter attack the government and to allow the Egyptians to use social media for giving latest updates, Google and Twitter launched a service that enabled them to leave a voicemail on a specific number. This voicemail was then posted in Twitter as a text message. Thus, people who didn't have a smart phone or didn't know how to use one could also post messages in social media.

%\item \textbf{Event-specific Information Content:}
